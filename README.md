# hello-world
This is my first GitHub contribution. I hope you like it :)
I am a 2D animator who started with Macromedia Flash and Macromedia Director many years ago. I love character animation and lately there have been a lot of innovation in the 2.5D character rigging space. I would love to see those improvements make their way into Adobe Animate CC.
I'm currently hoping to export Animate CC animation as .lottie files
